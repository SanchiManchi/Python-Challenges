#Pooja would like to withdraw X $US from an ATM. The cash machine will only accept the transaction if X is a multiple of 5, and Pooja's account balance has enough cash to perform the withdrawal transaction (including bank charges). For each successful withdrawal the bank charges 0.50 $US. Calculate Pooja's account balance after an attempted transaction.

money = int(input('How much money do you have in your account?'))
transact = int(input('how much money would you like to transact?'))

while transact%5 > 0 or transact > money:
  transact = int(input('Must be a multiple of 5 and you must transact less than what you have in your bank account. Please input new amount:'))

money = money - (transact + 0.5)

print(f'you have {money}$')
